# Motivation 

University life can often be accompanied by stress and mental fatigue. During these stressful periods, it is essential to find moments of respite that can not only alleviate mental tensions but can also improve cognitive well-being. We are also interested in game development and would like to use this opportunity to step into the world of game design. We hope to be able to expand upon our creativity and levy our skills to produce a game we can call our own.

# Aim 

We hope to reduce stress that students will have from their studies, allowing them to improve their mental wellness. We hope to develop a combat-oriented 2D platformer, which tests the skills and reflexes of the player, to both de-stress and improve upon their hand-eye coordination. While there are already many similar games out there, we aim to improve upon their positive aspects, by introducing unique mechanics and exciting gameplay. Furthermore, we aim to engage the audience with an interesting art style.

# User Stories

As a student who wants to de-stress, I want to be able to immerse myself in a fun and engaging combat game.
As a student who wants to try out a different method of relieving stress, I want to be able to try out a game with a cool art style.
As a person looking for a new hobby, I want to try out a different variation of games.
As someone who enjoys feeling accomplished, I want to be able to experience completing a challenging game.

# Features

Feature 1 (core): Interactable objects in the world (E.g level exit portals, hazards etc.)
Feature 2 (core): Player Health and Score System 
Feature 3 (core): Multiple Characters System (E.g Different characters who use different weapons: Sword, Axe, Bow etc.)
Feature 4 (core) : Feature 4 (core) : Player Power-ups (E.g Speed boost)
Feature 5 (extension): Object Destruction
Feature 6 (extension): Limited Player Vision (FOV of player will be limited)
Feature 7 (extension): Projectile Deflection 
Feature 8 (extension): Dual-Phase Boss Fight (Boss will change difficulty after certain conditions are met)

# Timeline

Milestone 1 - Technical proof of concept (i.e., a minimal working system with both the frontend and the backend integrated for a very simple feature)
Feature 1 (Interactable objects) implemented to skeleton level.

Milestone 2 - Prototype (i.e., a working system with the core features)
Feature 2 (Health and Score IU) 	Player Health and Score System
Feature 4 (Player Power-ups) implemented to basic functionality.

Milestone 3 - Extended system (i.e., a  working system with both the core + extension features)
Feature 5 (Limited Player Vision) implemented to desired level.
Feature 6 (Projectile Deflection) implemented to desired level.
Feature 7 (Object Destruction) implemented to desired level.
Feature 8 (Dual-Phase Boss Fight) implemented to basic functionality.

# Qualifications

Our team consists of two students enrolled in Computer Engineering with prior experiences such as CS1010. 

# Languages learnt: Python, C, C++

# Software Engineering

User Experience (UX) Design: We will be incorporating UX design to create intuitive and engaging player experiences. We will utilize user testing, and iterative design cycles to refine our game mechanics, interfaces, and interactions to meet player expectations and preferences.

Incremental Development: We will ensure that the game features and content are developed incrementally, with each iteration building upon the work of previous iterations. This allows us to prioritize and deliver key features.

Community Feedback and Engagement: We will actively engage with the game community and collect feedback from players. We will also incorporate these player-driven suggestions and insights into the development process to enhance the enjoyment of the game.

# Implemented Features

## Players
The user can choose different types of characters to play with. Currently, we only have one character, but we will be implementing choosable characters in the subsequent milestones.

Characters to be implemented:

Swordsman       Archer           Mage

## Enemies
The user has to attack these enemies to destory them. Otherwise, they will be damaged and dies when they are hit by these enemies. Click on left mouse button to shoot. The enemies will be defeated and disappear from the screen once it is hit at least once.

## Movements
Using the popular WASD keys for movement, we have binded the following keys to manuevere around the game.

W - Climb Up
A - Move Left
S - Climb Down
D - Move Right

## Camera Movements
The camera will follow the player to ensure a more realistic POV. The movements are smooth to allow for better User Experience.

## Game Flow
When the game starts, the user will have to clear the stage by reaching to the end point (demarcated by the exit sign). In the event the player dies, he will be teleported back to the same level at the starting position. In the event the player dies for the third time, he will be teleported back to the previous level at the starting position. The player will have to clear that stage before advancing to the subsequent level.

## Health IU
To be implemented.

## Score System
To be implemented.

## Pause/Resume Game
To be implemented.

# User Feedbacks
To be sourced.
